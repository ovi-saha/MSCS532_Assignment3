# MSCS532_Assignment3
This repo is assignment 2 for MSCS532 (Algorithm and Data Struture) course
# For part 1 
For Part 1 of this assignment run the **det_quick_sort.py** and **rand_quick_sort.py** seperatety. Both of them has a user input. User can choose how they want their array. Then compare the time with the output. From this part of the assignment I have found, det_quick_sort take less time than rand_quick_sort but for few cases like repeated and already sorted array, det_quick_sort takes more time compare to the other array types in det_qick_sort. The time difference is more.
# For part 2 
I did chaining for the hash table which can minimize the collision. To perform this run the **hash.py** code and it will give an output with insert, delete and serach.
# Analysis
